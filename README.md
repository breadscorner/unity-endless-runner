# 2D Endless Runner Game

Welcome to the **2D Endless Runner Game**, a Unity-based endless runner game featuring smooth animations, serialized variables, and prefabs for a dynamic experience. This project is currently in development and not yet hosted for public play, but you can explore the game by running the code locally.

## 🕹️ Game Features

- **Start Screen**: The entry point of the game where players can begin their endless running adventure.
- **Main Game Scene**: Players jump over hurdles (cones) with animated movements. On collision with a cone, the game ends and displays the final score.
- **End Screen**: Displays the current score and provides options to restart the game or return to the start screen.
- **Scene Transitions**: Seamless transitions between start, game, and end screens.
- **Serialized Variables**: Key game variables are serialized for easy adjustments.
- **Prefabs**: Efficient and reusable prefabs are used throughout the game.

## 📝 Scripts and Components

The game consists of:
- **5 Custom Scripts**: These scripts handle everything from player controls to scoring and transitions.
- **3 Scenes**: Start, Main Game, and End.
- **Animations**: Smooth player animations for jumping over obstacles.

Each scene and script is modular, enabling ease of updates and maintenance.
