# 2D Endless Runner Game

Welcome to the **2D Endless Runner Game**, a Unity-based endless runner where excitement meets precision coding! This project is currently in development and not yet hosted for public play, but you can explore the game by running the code locally.

## ðŸŽ® Game Features

- **Start Screen**: A welcoming entry point where players can start their endless running adventure or adjust settings through an intuitive menu.
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: Jump over hurdles (cones) with responsive, animated movements. Colliding with an obstacle ends the game.

- **Smooth Scene Transitions**: Effortlessly move between start, game, and end scenes.
- **Visually Engaging Animations**: Enjoy smooth, polished animations that bring the player and obstacles to life.

## ðŸ’» Coding Highlights

- **Serialized Variables**: Key game parameters are serialized, enabling developers to tweak gameplay mechanics with ease.
- **Prefab/Nested Prefabs Usage**: Prefabs are extensively used for obstacles, UI elements, and other GameObjects, ensuring modularity and efficient development.
- **Custom Scripts**: Modular scripts manage player movement, scoring, and collision detection, showcasing clean and maintainable code.
- **High Score Prompt Panel**: The system toggles a high score entry panel dynamically when a new record is achieved, demonstrating integration of UI and logic.
